$I_S(T)$
 1. If $Vout$ is 10V, I can assume that $V_C$ = 1mA.
 2. $I_B ≈ I_C/\beta$, so ($\beta = 100$) $I_B = 10 \mu A$? So...would that equate to something like 10V through a 1M resistor to the base? That seems...not right.

 3. that if $Vout$ is 10V, then $V_C$ = 1mA. Then, if $I_B ≈ I_C/\beta$, so ($\beta = 100$) $I_B = 10 \mu A$?

 4.  $\frac{I_{C_2}}{I_{C_1}}=e^\left(\frac{\Delta V_{_\text{BE}}}{V_T}\right)$
